# week6weather
Description
I designed a weather application that will display current weather and a 5 day forecast for any city destination entered. All styling is done with css, and data is fetched from an open weather api found here: https://openweathermap.org/api

Installation
To view my project go to: manyanara.github.io/week6weather in your web browser.

Usage
You can enter any city name in the searchbar to pull up weather prediction results.

Credits
While I did use Google and Youtube to troubleshoot any issues and questions I had, all code is original and written by me.


The website should look like:
